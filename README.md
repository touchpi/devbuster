# WSL devbuster image

Base fÃ¼r a WSL development environment for touchpi apps on a windows machine. The linux environment with amd64 libs is similar to an arm based Raspberry PI OS Buster (e.g. installed on an old Raspberry PI2 or a Raspberry Zero) and is intended for developing touchpi python3 apps.

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Docker Desktop
- WSL (default should be WSL2)
- Any WSL terminal environment (e.g. Ubuntu from MS Store)
- X Windows Server on windows machine (GWSL, XMing, VcXsrv,...)

### Install
- Create `C:\wsl` folder on your windows machine (you can use any other folder at C: but then you have to adjust some lines later)
- **Open WSL linux terminal** (e.g. Ubuntu)
- Build your own image
  - Clone this repo and `cd devbuster`
  - Optional: Change USERNAME, TZ in Dockerfile
  - Build local Docker image with: `docker build -t pitouch/devbuster .`
- or pull image from docker hub
  - `docker pull pitouch/devbuster`
- Run Docker container: `run -d pitouch/devbuster ls`  (container is created, runs and exits)
- Get your containerid with `docker container ls -a | grep -i devbuster | awk '{print $1}'`
- Export container: `docker export DockerContainerID > /mnt/c/wsl/devbuster.tar`
- **Open a window terminal** (e.g. Power Shell)
- Import from a window terminal with `wsl --import devbuster c:\wsl c:\wsl\devbuster.tar` (this will create the light-weight WSL2 virtual machine file ext4.vhdx in c:\wsl)
- **Open WSL devbuster shell** with `wsl -d devbuster`
- Check environment in WSL shell with `env`. If DISPLAY is not set, then add once the line `export DISPLAY=:0` in .bashrc (don't forget to stop and start shell again)
- Optional: `apt update` and `apt upgrade`
- Optional: install your favorite IDE (e.g. pycharm)
- Optional: insert your github ssh key with `nano ./.ssh/id_rsa`
- Clone forked touchpi repo
- cd to your touchpi folder
- Install touchpi once with `./scripts/install.sh` (venv and python requirements are installed)

### Cleanup
- The docker image and its container file are no longer needed and can be removed
- `/mnt/c/wsl/devbuster.tar` is no longer needed and can be deleted

### Use
- Run your X Windows Server
- Open your development shell with: `wsl -d devbuster`
- Default browser is chromium. Just enter `chromium` in your WSL shell. It should apear a X Window with the chromium browser. <ins>It is not recommended to use this browser for internet surfing</ins>, because it is an old version with lots of vulnerabilities. Just use it internally or use it only with well known internets sites (e.g. entering your pycharm licence key).
- `cd touchpi`
- Run touchpi with `./start.sh`. It will apear as X Window.
- Start your IDE in your WSL devbuster shell. If it is graphical it will apear as X Window. To run touchpi from an IDE, you have to set the python working directory to the folder touchpi/touchpi

Happy developing. Guides for developer and other image types are in work.
