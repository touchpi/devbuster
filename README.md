# WSL devbuster image (amd64 libs)

Base f√ºr WSL devlopment environment for touchpi python apps on a windows machine (amd64 libs).

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Docker Dekstop
- WSL (Default should be WSL2)
- Any WSL terminal environment (e.g. Ubuntu from MS Store)
- X Windows Server on windows machine (GWSL, XMing, VcXsrv,...)

### Install
- Build Docker image in a WSL linux terminal environment 
- Run Docker container (can be in exited status after a short running)
- Export from WSL linux terminal environment to a windows mount area e.g. /mnt/c/tmp
- Import from window terminal (e.g. Power Shell). This will create the light-wight WSL2 virtual machine.
- Run WSL shell with wsl -d <wsl_terminal_name>.
- Check environment in WSL shell with env. If DISPLAY is not set, then add once export DISPLAY=:0 in .bashrc (don't forget to stop and start shell again)
